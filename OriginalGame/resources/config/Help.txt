A House Divided is strictly a multiplayer game with no single player
elements included. In order to play, one person must start a new
game. This consists of picking a side and a map to be used. When
a message pops up telling you your IP address, tell that to your
partner and have them type that in under Join Game. 

Once you are in the map screen, you will see many things. Your
menu bar is on the right. At the top is a miniature map of the
battlefield. Below is basic information on your army. At the bottom is your building panel.

CP- Command Points, reach this limit and you cannot build more 
troops. Some buildings are only designed to augment CP and do 
nothing else. Some are required for training units. It is heavily 
recommended that you build coal mines to generate income first.

In order to place a building, you must go to within your building
zone. You start there at the beginning on the grid of
corresponding color to your side. Left click to confirm building, right 
click to cancel. Once you have trained a unit, select
him with left mouse and appoint a move location with right
clicks.

Your objective is to destroy all enemy units and buildings.
Best of luck to you, general!
